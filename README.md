## Educational Context

This simulation is designed for business school teaching, particularly:

- **Masters in Management** programmes covering innovation and technology strategy
- **Undergraduate electives** in innovation management, entrepreneurship, or technology strategy
- **MBA electives** in R&D management and corporate entrepreneurship
- **Executive Education** programmes for R&D leaders and product managers

The game teaches through discovery rather than instruction. Players experience the consequences of their portfolio decisions first-hand, developing intuition for balancing risk, managing stakeholders, and making difficult trade-offs under uncertainty. An in-game tutorial guides players through the mechanics.

## Research Foundations

The simulation is informed by research on:

- **R&D project selection** — How organisations evaluate and choose which innovation projects to fund
- **Decision-making in R&D** — The cognitive and organisational factors that shape funding decisions
- **Panel dynamics** — How selection committees function, including groupthink, advocacy, and consensus-building
- **Role tensions** — Conflicts between different functional perspectives (technical, commercial, financial, strategic) in project evaluation
- **Active portfolio management** — The importance of ongoing monitoring, resource reallocation, and project termination decisions
- **Strategic alignment** — Connecting R&D investments to corporate strategy and balancing short-term delivery with long-term capability building

## The Scenario

Players are appointed Head of R&D at ShieldTech India, a home security technology company. The previous R&D leader was dismissed after years of poor results—15 projects funded, only 4 successful. The CEO provides a budget and full authority to redesign how projects are selected and managed.

The board has set four strategic priorities that the portfolio should address:

- **Defend Metro Leadership** — Retain position in top cities against competitors
- **Tier 2/3 City Rollout** — Profitable entry into emerging cities
- **Recurring Revenue** — Shift from hardware sales to services and subscriptions
- **AI-First Products** — Lead the transition to intelligent security

## Game Flow

### 1. Design Your Selection Process
Players choose how project funding decisions will be made. Options include deciding alone, assembling a selection committee, using a staff jury, or random selection. Each approach has trade-offs between speed, expertise, bias, and buy-in.

When forming a committee, players select from ShieldTech's leadership team. Each person brings different expertise, perspectives, and biases—the CTO sees technical risk differently than the CFO sees financial risk. Committee composition shapes which projects get attention and support.

Players also choose evaluation criteria and approaches: structured scoring matrices, intuitive expert judgment, or staged gates with go/no-go checkpoints.

### 2. Handle Legacy Projects
The previous R&D leader left behind ongoing projects in various states. Players review each project's history, spending, progress, political context, and strategic alignment, then decide whether to continue, pause, or kill. Past spending is sunk—but stakeholder relationships and external commitments complicate decisions.

### 3. Committee Dynamics Mini-Game
Players chair a budget committee meeting where they must secure funding for new projects. Committee members debate, advocate for their preferred approaches, and react to how the meeting is facilitated. The outcome determines the budget available—ranging from $34M to $44M depending on how well the dynamics are managed.

### 4. Build Your Portfolio
Players evaluate 10-12 project proposals. Each project comes with rich information:

- **Project overview** — Description, strategic rationale, and market context
- **Development milestones** — Phased deliverables with timelines and costs
- **Team profiles** — Project leads with track records and expertise
- **Technology readiness** — Current and target TRL (Technology Readiness Level)
- **IP position** — Patents, freedom to operate, and competitive landscape
- **Competitor analysis** — Who else is pursuing similar opportunities
- **Financial projections** — Budget requirements and potential returns
- **Risk assessment** — Technical, market, and execution risks

The committee provides feedback on each project, with different members highlighting different concerns. Players categorise projects as Fund, Consider, or Stop, then build a portfolio within budget constraints using matrix visualisations to assess balance across risk levels and strategic priorities.

### 5. Manage Through Time
The simulation runs for 8 quarters (2 years). Each quarter, players:

- **Review progress reports** — See how each project is performing against milestones, with status indicators and narrative updates
- **Respond to management dilemmas** — Over 60 scenarios involving team conflicts, technical setbacks, competitive threats, resource constraints, and stakeholder pressures
- **Make portfolio decisions** — For each project, choose to continue at current pace, accelerate (more resources, faster timeline), reduce (fewer resources, extended timeline), or kill

### 6. Year 2 Opportunities
At the end of Year 1, new project opportunities emerge. Players evaluate fresh proposals and decide whether to add them to the portfolio or stay focused on existing commitments. A mid-point budget review may adjust available resources based on Year 1 performance.

### 7. See the Results
At the end of Year 2, players discover which projects truly succeeded or failed. The board evaluates performance across multiple dimensions:

- **Selection accuracy** — Did you fund winners and reject losers?
- **Portfolio returns** — What ROI did your investments generate?
- **Risk balance** — How did you mix safe bets with ambitious projects?
- **Strategic alignment** — Did you cover the board's priorities?
- **Portfolio management** — Were your kill decisions well-timed?
- **Active leadership** — Did you make decisions or let the portfolio drift?

## Career Outcomes

The board delivers a verdict based on overall performance. Outcomes range from:

- **Promoted to CTO** — Exceptional results with balanced risk-taking and good portfolio discipline
- **Lead New Corporate Venture** — Strong success spotting and scaling winners
- **Promoted to Senior Director** — Solid judgment and well-timed decisions
- **Retained with Bonus** — Acceptable results, room for improvement
- **Performance Improvement Plan** — Concerns about selection or management
- **Reassigned to Operations** — Poor results or overly conservative approach
- **Position Eliminated** — Portfolio disaster with major losses

Playing it too safe is penalised—the board hired an R&D leader to find breakthrough innovations, not just optimise existing products. But reckless risk-taking without discipline also fails. Success requires balancing ambition with judgment.

## Learning Objectives

Through gameplay, students learn to:

- **Design selection processes** — Choose decision-making structures and evaluation approaches, understanding how process design affects outcomes
- **Evaluate innovation proposals** — Assess technical feasibility, market potential, strategic alignment, and team capability
- **Balance portfolio risk** — Mix incremental improvements with transformational bets to achieve strategic objectives
- **Make tough resource allocation decisions** — Categorise projects and allocate limited budgets across competing opportunities
- **Manage portfolios actively over time** — Decide when to persist with struggling projects and when to cut losses
- **Navigate organisational dynamics** — Handle real-world situations like team conflicts, budget pressures, competitor moves, and political considerations
- **Recognise decision-making biases** — Understand how committee composition, evaluation methods, and cognitive biases affect selection outcomes

## Using in Teaching

The simulation works well as:

- **Pre-class preparation** — Students play before a session on portfolio management, bringing their results and experiences to discussion
- **In-class activity** — A 60-90 minute guided session where students play and then debrief together
- **Assessment component** — Students submit reflection reports analysing their decisions and outcomes
- **Group exercise** — Teams can play together, discussing and debating each decision

Discussion questions might include:
- How did your selection process affect which projects got funded?
- What signals did you use to decide whether to continue or kill a project?
- How did you balance safe bets against riskier transformational projects?
- What would you do differently if you played again?
