# Build, Bin, Boost: Class Exercises

Structured activities for individual, team, and competitive play, plus reflective learning exercises.

---

## Exercise 1: Individual Play with Decision Log

**Mode**: Individual  
**Time**: 60-90 minutes (play) + 30 minutes (analysis)  
**Purpose**: Develop awareness of personal decision-making patterns

### Instructions

1. **Before playing**, create a simple decision log with these columns:
   - Decision point (e.g., "Project selection: SmartLock 2.0")
   - Your choice
   - Your reasoning (2-3 sentences)
   - Confidence level (High / Medium / Low)

2. **During play**, pause at key decision points to log:
   - Committee composition choices
   - Legacy project decisions (at least 3)
   - Project funding decisions (at least 5)
   - Kill/continue decisions during quarterly reviews (at least 3)

3. **After playing**, review your log and answer:
   - Which decisions were you most confident about? Were confidence and outcome correlated?
   - Do you notice patterns in your reasoning? (e.g., always favouring technical projects, avoiding risk, trusting certain committee members)
   - Which decisions would you change with hindsight? Is that hindsight bias or genuine learning?

### Debrief Questions
- What did your decision log reveal about your tendencies?
- How did your confidence levels relate to actual outcomes?
- What heuristics or mental shortcuts did you use?

## Exercise 2: Team Play with Role Assignment

**Mode**: Teams of 3-4  
**Time**: 75-90 minutes (play) + 30 minutes (debrief)  
**Purpose**: Experience committee dynamics and practice collaborative decision-making

### Setup

Assign each team member a perspective to advocate:

| Role | Perspective |
|------|-------------|
| **The Visionary** | Advocates for ambitious, transformational projects. "We need breakthrough innovation." |
| **The Pragmatist** | Advocates for proven, lower-risk projects. "Let's fund what we know can work." |
| **The Strategist** | Focuses on alignment with board priorities. "Does this fit our strategic direction?" |
| **The Sceptic** | Questions assumptions and highlights risks. "What could go wrong here?" |

### Instructions

1. **Play together** on one screen, discussing each major decision
2. Each team member **must advocate from their assigned perspective** during discussions
3. When the team disagrees, use a structured approach:
   - Each perspective gets 1 minute to make their case
   - Then vote or reach consensus
4. **Track disagreements**: Note decisions where the team was split and how you resolved them

### Debrief Questions
- How did having assigned roles change the discussion?
- Which perspective "won" most often? Why?
- Were there decisions that improved because of the debate?
- How did you resolve conflicts? Was that effective?
- How does this compare to real committee dynamics in organisations?

## Exercise 3: Competitive Tournament

**Mode**: Individuals or teams competing  
**Time**: 60-90 minutes (play) + 45 minutes (analysis and awards)  
**Purpose**: Create stakes, compare strategies, and analyse what drives success

### Setup

1. Announce that participants will compete for best portfolio performance
2. Define success metric (suggest: career outcome tier, with ROI as tiebreaker)
3. Optional: Offer a small prize for winner(s)

### Competition Structure

**Round 1: The Main Event**
- Everyone plays the simulation once
- Record final outcome and key metrics (career outcome, ROI, hit rate)

**Round 2: Analysis Phase**
- Rank all participants by outcome
- Identify top 3 and bottom 3 performers
- Top performers briefly present their strategy (3 minutes each)
- Bottom performers share what they'd do differently

**Round 3: Discussion**
- Was success driven by strategy or luck?
- Did the top performers do anything systematically different?
- What can we learn from the failures?

### Variation: Strategy Showdown

Before playing, each participant/team publicly commits to a strategy:

- **The Diversifier**: "I will fund at least one project in each strategic bucket"
- **The Concentrator**: "I will focus 70%+ of budget on AI-First projects"
- **The Risk-Taker**: "I will fund mostly ambitious, high-risk projects"
- **The Conservative**: "I will fund mostly proven, lower-risk projects"
- **The Active Manager**: "I will kill at least 3 projects during the game"

After playing, analyse which strategies performed best and discuss why.

### Debrief Questions
- What separated winners from losers?
- How much of the variance was skill versus luck?
- Did any "losing" strategies actually represent good decision-making with bad luck?
- What does this tell us about evaluating real R&D leaders?

## Exercise 4: Reflective Learning Report

**Mode**: Individual (post-play)  
**Time**: 60-90 minutes to write  
**Purpose**: Consolidate learning through structured reflection  
**Output**: 1,000-1,500 word written report

### Report Structure

**Section 1: My Strategy (300-400 words)**
- What selection process did I design and why?
- What was my portfolio strategy? (risk mix, strategic coverage, number of projects)
- How did I plan to manage the portfolio over time?

**Section 2: Key Decisions (400-500 words)**
Choose 2-3 pivotal decisions and for each:
- What was the situation?
- What did I decide and why?
- What was the outcome?
- Evaluating the decision quality (separate from outcome): was it a good decision?

**Section 3: Surprises and Lessons (300-400 words)**
- What surprised me during the simulation?
- What assumptions did I have that proved wrong?
- What would I do differently if I played again?

**Section 4: Connections to Course Concepts (200-300 words)**
- How does my experience connect to concepts from the course?
- What theories or frameworks help explain what happened?

### Grading Criteria (if assessed)

| Criterion | Excellent | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Self-awareness | Honest reflection on reasoning and biases | Some reflection on decisions | Purely descriptive, no critical analysis |
| Decision analysis | Separates decision quality from outcomes | Mostly focuses on what worked | Judges decisions only by outcomes |
| Theory connection | Specific, relevant links to course material | General connections made | No meaningful connection to theory |
| Learning articulation | Clear, actionable lessons for future | Some lessons identified | No clear takeaways |

## Exercise 5: Before-and-After Strategy Comparison

**Mode**: Individual or team  
**Time**: 2 playthroughs (90-180 minutes total) + 30 minutes analysis  
**Purpose**: Test whether learning transfers across attempts

### Instructions

**First Playthrough**
1. Play the simulation once without any preparation
2. Record your final outcome and key metrics
3. Write a brief note: "Next time I would..."

**Reflection Gap**
- Wait at least 24 hours (or until next class session)
- Review course materials on portfolio management or relevant theory

**Second Playthrough**
1. Before starting, write down your revised strategy
2. Play again, deliberately implementing your new approach
3. Record outcomes and metrics

**Comparison Analysis**
- What did you change between playthroughs?
- Did your results improve? Why or why not?
- Which changes had the most impact?
- What did you learn that you couldn't have learned from reading alone?

### Debrief Questions
- How much did outcomes improve on the second attempt?
- Was improvement due to better strategy or better luck?
- What's the value of experiential learning versus studying theory?

## Exercise 6: The Post-Mortem

**Mode**: Small groups (4-6 students)  
**Time**: 45-60 minutes  
**Purpose**: Practice structured analysis of portfolio outcomes

### Setup
All participants should have completed the simulation before this exercise.

### Instructions

1. **Select a case** (15 minutes)
   - One group member volunteers to present their playthrough
   - They share: strategy, key decisions, final outcome, metrics

2. **Structured analysis** (20 minutes)
   - Group acts as a "board review committee" analysing what happened
   - Use these lenses:
     - **Selection**: Were the right projects funded? Were good ones rejected?
     - **Balance**: Was the portfolio appropriately diversified or concentrated?
     - **Management**: Were ongoing decisions (continue/kill) well-timed?
     - **Process**: Did the selection process help or hinder good decisions?

3. **Recommendations** (10 minutes)
   - What should this R&D leader do differently next time?
   - What organisational changes would help?

4. **Reflection** (5-10 minutes)
   - Presenter responds: Do you agree with the analysis? What did you learn?

### Variation: Comparative Post-Mortem
Compare the highest and lowest performing students in the group. What systematic differences explain the gap?

## Quick Discussion Questions

For shorter debrief sessions, use these questions selectively:

### On Selection
- How did you decide which projects to fund?
- What made a project attractive to you? What made you reject projects?
- How much did committee feedback influence your decisions?

### On Portfolio Composition
- How many projects did you fund? Was that the right number?
- How did you balance safe versus risky projects?
- Did you deliberately cover all strategic priorities or concentrate?

### On Ongoing Management
- Which project was hardest to kill? Why?
- Did you use accelerate or reduce options? When and why?
- What signals told you a project was in trouble?

### On Process Design
- How did your committee composition affect decisions?
- Would a different evaluation approach have led to different choices?
- What perspectives were missing from your process?

### On Outcomes
- Were you surprised by which projects succeeded or failed?
- Do you think your outcome was fair given your decisions?
- What's the difference between a good decision and a good outcome?

### On Learning
- What's one thing you learned that you couldn't have learned from a lecture?
- What will you remember from this simulation a year from now?
- How does this change how you think about R&D management?

## Adapting for Your Context

### For Shorter Sessions (30 minutes debrief)
- Use 3-4 Quick Discussion Questions
- Focus on one theme (e.g., just selection, or just portfolio management)
- Have students share in pairs before full-class discussion

### For Longer Sessions (90+ minutes debrief)
- Combine competitive play with post-mortem analysis
- Add theory mini-lecture between play and debrief
- Include written reflection component

### For Executive Education
- Emphasise connections to participants' real organisational contexts
- Use team play to leverage diverse professional experience
- Focus discussion on implementation: "What would this mean for your organisation?"

### For Undergraduate Courses
- Provide more structure and guidance during play
- Use team play to maintain engagement
- Focus on foundational concepts rather than advanced theory
