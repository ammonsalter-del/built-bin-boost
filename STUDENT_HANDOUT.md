# Build, Bin, Boost: Student Handout

## Your Mission

You've just been appointed Head of R&D at ShieldTech India, a home security technology company. Your predecessor was fired after years of poor results. The board is giving you a budget and full authority to redesign how projects are selected and managed—and they expect results.

## What You'll Do

| Phase | Your Task |
|-------|-----------|
| **1. Design your process** | Choose how decisions will be made. Assemble a committee? Use scoring criteria? Each choice has trade-offs. |
| **2. Handle legacy projects** | Your predecessor left ongoing projects. Continue, pause, or kill? Sunk costs shouldn't drive decisions—but politics might. |
| **3. Secure your budget** | Chair a committee meeting (mini-game). How you facilitate affects how much funding you get. |
| **4. Build your portfolio** | Evaluate 10-12 proposals with rich detail on milestones, teams, technology readiness, IP, and competitors. Decide what to fund. |
| **5. Manage over 8 quarters** | Review progress, respond to dilemmas, and decide: continue, accelerate, reduce, or kill each project. |
| **6. Add Year 2 projects** | New opportunities emerge. Add to your portfolio or stay focused? |
| **7. See results** | Discover what succeeded and failed. The board delivers their verdict. |

## Strategic Priorities

The board has set four priorities. Your portfolio should address these:

- 🛡️ **Defend Metro Leadership** — Protect position in top cities
- 🗺️ **Tier 2/3 Rollout** — Expand into emerging cities  
- 💳 **Recurring Revenue** — Shift to services and subscriptions
- 🤖 **AI-First Products** — Lead the transition to intelligent security

## How You're Evaluated

The board judges you on:

- **Selection accuracy** — Did you fund winners and reject losers?
- **Portfolio returns** — What ROI did your investments generate?
- **Risk balance** — Did you mix safe bets with ambitious projects appropriately?
- **Strategic alignment** — Did you cover the priorities without over-concentrating?
- **Portfolio management** — Were your kill decisions well-timed?
- **Active leadership** — Did you make decisions or let things drift?

**Outcomes range from promotion to CTO down to being fired.** Playing it too safe is penalised—but so is reckless risk-taking.

## Tips

✓ **Read the details** — Click on projects and people to see full profiles. The information matters.

✓ **Think about your mix** — Some projects are safer; others are ambitious. What balance makes sense?

✓ **Watch for signals** — Quarterly updates tell you how things are really going. Pay attention.

✓ **Be willing to kill** — Cutting losses on failing projects is rewarded. Sunk costs are sunk.

✓ **But don't kill too early** — Some projects need patience. Premature termination wastes potential.

✓ **Committee composition matters** — Different people see different risks and opportunities.

## After Playing

Be prepared to discuss:

1. What was your selection strategy? How did you decide what to fund?
2. Which decision was hardest? Why?
3. What signals did you use to continue or kill projects?
4. What would you do differently if you played again?
5. What surprised you about your results?
